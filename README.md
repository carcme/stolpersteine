### WHAT ARE THEY
Stolpersteine or Stumbling Blocks are an art project by Gunter Demnig.
Started in 1996, there are now more than 67,000 Stolpersteine laid in 22
countries, making it the world's largest decentralized memorial. They commemorate
victims of the Holocaust at the last freely chosen place of residency prior to
their expulsion and extermination


### ORIGIN OF THE NAME
The German term Stolperstein can mean "potential problem" and to "stumble across
something", means "to find by chance". Stolpersteine are not prominently placed,
rather discovered by chance and only recognisable when passing close by.

The term Stolperstein is designed to invokes an anti-semitic remark of the past
while provoking thoughts of the persecution experienced by the person who lived here
